The preliminary pages of this project paper have been meticulously updated to reflect the
revised scope and technical approach. This includes the Cover Page, Title Page, Declaration,
Approval Page, Dedication, Acknowledgement, List of Figures, and List of Tables. A significant
adjustment involves the removal of "with Machine Learning" from the project's title on the Title

1

Page and Declaration, aligning with the shift in the system's core prediction methodology. This
alteration in the project's identity is more than a superficial change; it fundamentally redefines
the project's central focus. Initially, the project aimed to showcase advanced algorithmic
sophistication in healthcare. The revised title signals a pivot towards a system built on explicit,
rule-based logic, emphasizing clarity, interpretability, and robustness, particularly within
environments where complex machine learning infrastructure might present practical
challenges. This re-orientation also influences how the project's contribution to knowledge,
discussed in Chapter 5.4, is framed. The decision to move away from machine learning may
stem from practical considerations such as data limitations, computational resource availability,
or a preference for a more transparent and auditable system in a medical context, where the
"black-box" nature of some machine learning models can hinder adoption.

Abstract
The abstract has been completely rewritten to accurately represent the system's revised
prediction approach, moving away from machine learning to a rule-based methodology. The
original abstract heavily emphasized machine learning as the solution to diabetes management

1

challenges. The new abstract maintains the focus on the critical public health problem of rising
diabetes prevalence, limited access to diagnostic facilities, and high rates of undiagnosed cases

1

in regions like Nigeria. However, it now proposes a distinct technical solution.
The revised abstract states that the project aims to design and implement an "Online Diabetes
Check and Treatment Recommendation System." It clarifies that the system provides an
accessible, cost-effective, and efficient platform for early diabetes risk assessment and
guidance by leveraging a manually defined, rule-based logic to predict the likelihood of
diabetes and offer preliminary treatment recommendations based on user-provided health

1

parameters. The methodology employed remains object-oriented analysis and design. The
core prediction mechanism is now based on a set of

predefined clinical rules and thresholds applied to key user-input parameters such as
glucose level, HbA1c, and BMI. This explicit logic ensures transparency and interpretability in
risk stratification. The system is integrated into a user-friendly web application built with Python

1

(Flask) and a simple HTML/CSS frontend. The successful implementation of this system
demonstrates the potential of explicit, rule-based logic to bridge healthcare gaps, empower
individuals in self-management of health, and support preliminary clinical decision-making,
especially in resource-constrained environments where transparency and simplicity are
paramount.
This re-framing of the abstract signifies a fundamental shift in the project's perceived innovation
and contribution. The project's value proposition is no longer centered on pushing the
boundaries of predictive analytics with complex algorithms. Instead, it highlights the design and
implementation of a transparent, interpretable, and easily maintainable system. This
re-alignment underscores the project's commitment to demonstrating the practical utility of
simpler, yet effective, digital health tools for immediate public health impact. This approach is
particularly relevant in contexts where extensive data for complex machine learning models
might be scarce or unreliable, or where computational resources are limited. This strategic pivot
aligns the project more closely with the immediate, practical needs of a developing country's
healthcare system, where simplicity, low cost, and clear logic are often prioritized over
cutting-edge, but potentially opaque, machine learning models.

CHAPTER ONE - INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background of the Study
Diabetes mellitus has escalated into a global pandemic, affecting millions and straining

1

healthcare systems worldwide. Characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, the disease's
global prevalence doubled from 7% in 1990 to 14% in 2022, with projections indicating a rise to

1

783 million by 2045. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported 537 million adults

1

living with diabetes in 2021. This exponential growth is driven by urbanization, sedentary

1

lifestyles, dietary changes, and an aging population. The burden is disproportionately felt in
low- and middle-income countries, including Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, with an

1

estimated 229 million people as of June 2024.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates diabetes prevalence in Nigeria at 4.3%, with

1

various researchers reporting rates from 2% to 12% across the country. A major challenge is
the high rate of undiagnosed cases and prediabetes. Approximately 15.8 million Nigerians may
have prediabetes, a significant population at risk of developing full-blown diabetes without

1

intervention. This situation is exacerbated by limited access to healthcare facilities, low public

awareness, and the cost of diagnostic tests, leading to delayed treatment and increased

1

morbidity and mortality from complications. More than half (59%) of adults aged 30 and over

1

with diabetes in 2022 were not taking medication, highlighting a critical gap in care.

Conventional diabetes diagnosis relies on resource-intensive laboratory tests such as Fasting
Plasma Glucose (FPG), Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c),
which require clinical infrastructure and trained personnel often lacking in underserved

1

communities. Digital technologies offer a transformative opportunity to address these
challenges. While prior research has extensively explored machine learning and artificial

1

intelligence applications in diabetes prediction , this study adopts a different approach. It seeks
to develop an online system for diabetes risk assessment and treatment recommendation by
leveraging a
rule-based internal logic, rather than machine learning. This strategic choice is made to
address the practical needs of the Nigerian context, where simpler, more transparent, and easily
deployable digital health tools may offer more immediate and sustainable benefits compared to
complex machine learning models that demand extensive data, computational power, and
specialized expertise for deployment and maintenance in resource-constrained settings. This
re-justification of the project's technical direction is rooted in a pragmatic assessment of existing
healthcare challenges.

1.2 Statement of the Problem
The management of diabetes in Nigeria is hindered by several interconnected problems that the
current healthcare system struggles to address effectively. These challenges are exacerbated

1

by the country's socioeconomic conditions and healthcare infrastructure limitations. A
significant number of Nigerians with diabetes remain undiagnosed due to lack of awareness, the
asymptomatic nature of early-stage Type 2 diabetes, and limited access to affordable diagnostic

1

services, particularly in rural areas. More than 50% of people living with diabetes are unaware

1

of their condition, allowing the disease to progress unchecked.

Nigeria's healthcare system faces significant challenges in diabetes management, including a
critically low doctor-to-patient ratio and concentration of specialist care in urban centers, leaving

1

rural communities underserved. The direct and indirect costs associated with diabetes

1

management impose a heavy financial burden, often pushing families into deeper poverty.

Treatment plans are frequently generic, leading to suboptimal health outcomes due to a lack of

1

personalized medicine approaches. Public awareness about diabetes risk factors and

1

prevention strategies is insufficient, resulting in missed opportunities for primary prevention.

While digital health solutions are gaining traction globally, Nigeria has been slow to adopt
technology-enabled healthcare delivery systems, with existing solutions often unsuitable for the

1

local context. Furthermore, comprehensive, population-based diabetes screening programs

1

are lacking, meaning many at-risk individuals are not identified until complications arise.

Therefore, there is a pressing need for an accessible, low-cost, and intelligent system that can
facilitate early risk detection, provide personalized actionable guidance, and bridge the gap
between health needs and available healthcare resources. This system must be culturally
appropriate, linguistically accessible, and designed to function within the constraints of Nigeria's

1

healthcare infrastructure. The consistency in framing the problem highlights that the core
healthcare challenge remains unchanged, irrespective of the technical solution proposed. The
shift to a rule-based approach is a change in
how this problem is addressed, not what the problem is, reinforcing the project's commitment to
addressing a critical public health issue.

1.3 Aim and Objectives of the Study
The primary aim of this study is to design, develop, and implement a comprehensive web-based
system that utilizes a predefined, rule-based logic to provide accessible, accurate, and
personalized diabetes risk assessment and evidence-based treatment recommendations for the
Nigerian population. This revised aim clarifies the system's core mechanism, moving away from

1

the previous emphasis on machine learning algorithms.
The specific objectives are:

1.​ Rule-Based Prediction Logic Development and Validation:
○​ To define and implement a robust set of clinical rules and thresholds that
accurately predict the risk and type of diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, Gestational)
based on key user-provided clinical and demographic features.
○​ To validate the effectiveness and consistency of the rule-based prediction logic
against established clinical guidelines and a curated dataset.
○​ To ensure the rule-based logic provides clear, interpretable decision pathways for
risk stratification.
2.​ Comprehensive System Design and Implementation:
○​ To design and implement a user-friendly, responsive web-based application that

1

seamlessly integrates the predictive logic.

○​ To create an intuitive interface that allows users to input their health data and

1

receive immediate, personalized risk assessment.

○​ To ensure the system is accessible across different devices and internet

1

connectivity levels common in Nigeria.

3.​ Personalized Treatment Recommendation Engine:
○​ To develop an intelligent recommendation system that provides personalized,
evidence-based treatment and lifestyle recommendations based on the prediction

1

outcome.

○​ To incorporate current clinical guidelines and best practices for diabetes

1

management into the recommendation algorithm.

○​ To ensure recommendations are culturally sensitive and appropriate for the

1

Nigerian healthcare context.

4.​ System Validation and Performance Evaluation:
○​ To conduct comprehensive testing of the system's functionality, accuracy, and

1

user experience.

○​ To evaluate the system's performance across different user scenarios and input

1

variations.

○​ To assess the system's potential impact on early diabetes detection and health

1

outcome improvement.

The revision of Objective 1 highlights a fundamental shift in how "success" is defined and
measured. For a rule-based system, the validation process moves from statistical model
validation (e.g., cross-validation, AUC-ROC) to validating the rules themselves against expert
knowledge or a gold-standard dataset. The focus is on rule coverage, consistency, and
interpretability, rather than purely statistical generalization. This underscores a key difference in
how performance is assessed between machine learning and rule-based systems, where
transparency and direct clinical applicability often take precedence over statistical optimization.

1.4 Scope of the Study
This study encompasses the complete development lifecycle of a rule-based diabetes prediction
and recommendation system. The scope includes:
Prediction Logic Components:
●​ Rule Definition: Establishment of a comprehensive set of if-then rules and thresholds
for classifying diabetes risk and type based on clinical parameters (Age, BMI, HbA1c).
●​ Logic Implementation: Translation of defined rules into executable code within the
system's backend.
●​ Logic Validation: Verification of the rule-based system's output against a test dataset
and clinical expectations to ensure consistency and correctness.

System Functionality:
●​ Risk Prediction: Classification of users into risk categories (Low Risk, Prediabetes,

1

Type 1, Type 2, Gestational Diabetes).

●​ Personalized Recommendations: Generation of tailored advice covering dietary

1

modifications, physical activity, lifestyle changes, and medical follow-up suggestions.
●​ Educational Components: Integration of diabetes awareness and educational

1

content.

●​ Multi-language Support: Consideration for major Nigerian languages for broader

1

accessibility.

Technology Implementation:
●​ Backend Development: Python-based backend using Flask framework for robust

1

server-side processing.

●​ Frontend Interface: Responsive web design using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for

1

cross-device compatibility.

●​ Data Security: Implementation of secure data handling practices and user privacy

1

protection.

●​ Cloud Deployment: Preparation for cloud-based deployment for scalability and

1

accessibility.
Target Population:

1

●​ Primary focus on Nigerian adults aged 18-65 years.

●​ Special consideration for high-risk populations including urban professionals, individuals

1

with family history of diabetes, and those with sedentary lifestyles.

1

●​ Design considerations for varying literacy levels and technological familiarity.
Limitations and Ethical Considerations:

●​ Clinical Disclaimer: The system is designed as a screening and educational tool, not a

1

substitute for professional medical diagnosis or treatment.

●​ Recommendation Scope: General, evidence-based recommendations with strong
advisement for users to consult healthcare professionals for definitive diagnosis and

1

personalized treatment plans.

●​ Data Privacy: Commitment to user data protection and privacy, with minimal data

1

collection and secure handling practices.

●​ Accuracy Constraints: The system's accuracy is dependent on the completeness and
precision of the defined rules rather than statistical performance of a model. The rules
may not capture all cultural and genetic variations specific to different Nigerian

1

populations.

The explicit inclusion of "Rule Definition" and "Logic Implementation" in the scope highlights that
the transparency of the prediction mechanism is a core feature of this system. Unlike machine
learning, where interpretability is often a complex, post-hoc task, a rule-based system's logic is
inherently transparent. This is a significant advantage in medical applications where
understanding why a prediction is made is crucial for trust and adoption. This design choice
aligns with the growing demand for explainable AI in healthcare, demonstrating that even
simpler systems can directly address the need for clear explanations.

1.5 Significance of the Study
This research holds significant importance for multiple stakeholders and contributes to several
critical areas of healthcare, technology, and public health policy.
Healthcare Accessibility and Equity:
●​ Democratizing Healthcare Access: The system provides a low-cost, easily accessible
tool for diabetes screening, overcoming geographical and financial barriers that prevent

1

many Nigerians from receiving timely healthcare.

●​ Rural Healthcare Support: It is particularly beneficial for rural communities where

1

specialist diabetes care is limited or non-existent.

●​ 24/7 Availability: Unlike traditional healthcare services, the system provides

1

round-the-clock access to health screening and information.
Public Health Impact:

●​ Early Detection and Prevention: By enabling early risk assessment, the system can
help identify at-risk individuals sooner, potentially preventing or delaying the onset of

1

diabetes and its complications.

●​ Population Health Screening: It contributes to large-scale diabetes screening efforts,

1

helping to identify the true burden of diabetes in Nigeria.

●​ Preventive Care Focus: The system shifts the healthcare approach from reactive

1

treatment to proactive prevention and early intervention.
Patient Empowerment and Health Literacy:

1

long-term costs associated with diabetes complications.

●​ Decision Support: Provides healthcare professionals with additional data and and

1

insights to support clinical decision-making.
Technological and Scientific Contributions:

●​ Digital Health Innovation: This project contributes to the advancement of digital health
solutions in Nigeria by demonstrating the practical application of transparent,
rule-based logic in healthcare. It provides a template for similar health prediction
systems that prioritize clarity and maintainability.
●​ Research Framework: The study provides a replicable framework for developing and
validating explicit, interpretable decision systems for other chronic diseases prevalent
in Nigeria.
●​ Local Context Adaptation: It demonstrates how straightforward computational logic
can be adapted to local healthcare challenges and cultural contexts, prioritizing clarity
and maintainability.
The emphasis on "transparent, rule-based logic" and "straightforward computational logic"
subtly re-positions the project's value proposition. It moves from being solely about
"cutting-edge machine learning" to highlighting the creation of highly practical and contextually

appropriate technology. In environments with limited technical infrastructure or expertise, a
system that is easy to understand, debug, and modify due to its explicit rules can offer more
immediate and sustainable benefits than a complex machine learning model. This underscores
that technological solutions do not always need to be the most complex to be the most
impactful, especially within developing regions, where simplicity and transparency can be
significant advantages.

The updated description for Chapter Three directly reflects the supervisor's instruction to
change the prediction approach. This ensures that the table of contents accurately represents
the paper's content, maintaining academic integrity and providing a clear roadmap for the
reader.

1.7 Definition of Terms
To ensure clarity and precision, this section defines key terms used throughout the study. The
vocabulary has been carefully selected to reflect the project's shift from a machine
learning-centric approach to a rule-based system.
●​ Diabetes Mellitus: A group of chronic metabolic diseases characterized by elevated
levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia) resulting from defects in insulin production,
insulin action, or both. Over time, diabetes leads to serious damage to the heart, blood

1

vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves.

●​ Type 1 Diabetes: An autoimmune condition where the body's immune system attacks
and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, resulting in little or no insulin
production. It typically develops in childhood or young adulthood and requires lifelong

1

insulin therapy.

●​ Type 2 Diabetes: The most common form of diabetes, accounting for approximately
90-95% of all diabetes cases. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or

1

when the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels.

●​ Gestational Diabetes: A form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy in women
who did not previously have diabetes. It typically resolves after childbirth but increases

1

the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.

●​ Prediabetes: A condition where blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not
high enough to be classified as diabetes. It represents a critical intervention point where

1

lifestyle changes can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes.

●​ Flask: A lightweight, flexible Python web framework designed for building web
applications. It provides the basic tools and features needed to build web applications

1

without imposing a particular project or code layout.

●​ Hyperglycemia: An abnormally high level of glucose in the blood, typically defined as
blood glucose levels above 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) when fasting or above 200 mg/dL

1

(11.1 mmol/L) at any time.

●​ Body Mass Index (BMI): A measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies
to adult men and women. It is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in

1

meters squared (kg/m²).

●​ Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): A blood test that measures the average blood glucose
levels over the past 2 to 3 months. It reflects the percentage of hemoglobin proteins that

1

are coated with glucose and is expressed as a percentage.

●​ Digital Health: The use of digital technologies and tools to support healthcare delivery,
patient monitoring, and health management. It encompasses telemedicine, mobile health

1

applications, electronic health records, and AI-powered diagnostic tools.

●​ Rule-Based System: A system that uses a set of predefined "if-then" statements or
rules to make decisions or predictions, typically based on expert knowledge or
established criteria. In this study, it refers to the core logic for diabetes risk assessment.
●​ Thresholds: Specific numeric values or ranges used in rule-based systems to
categorize continuous data (e.g., BMI, HbA1c) into discrete classes or risk levels.
●​ Decision Logic: The explicit, step-by-step reasoning process encoded in the system's
rules, which determines the output (e.g., diabetes type, risk level) based on input
parameters.
●​ Expert System: An artificial intelligence system that emulates the decision-making
ability of a human expert, typically using a knowledge base of facts and rules.
The removal of machine learning terms and the addition of terms specific to rule-based systems
in this section are foundational to how the entire paper is understood. This lexical shift signals a
complete paradigm change, ensuring that readers approach the technical discussions in

subsequent chapters with the correct conceptual framework. It also implies a transition in the
type of technical expertise being demonstrated: from statistical modeling to logical system
design and implementation.

CHAPTER TWO - LITERATURE REVIEW
This chapter reviews existing literature relevant to the study. It covers the conceptual
background of diabetes and its management, the theoretical framework of rule-based systems
in healthcare, a review of similar systems, and finally, identifies the gap in the literature that this
research aims to fill.

2.1 Conceptual Review
2.1.1 The Global Perspective of Diabetes
Diabetes has emerged as a global health emergency, with unprecedented growth rates. The
World Health Organization (WHO) identifies it as a major cause of blindness, kidney failure,

1

heart attacks, stroke, and lower limb amputation. The latest International Diabetes Federation
(IDF) Diabetes Atlas (2025) reports that 11.1%—or 1 in 9—of the adult population (20-79 years)

1

is living with diabetes, with over 4 in 10 unaware of their condition. This represents a significant
increase from previous estimates, with projections indicating that by 2050, 1 in 8 adults will be

1

living with diabetes. The rapid increase in prevalence is linked to global trends in obesity,

1

unhealthy diets, and physical inactivity.

The economic impact of diabetes is staggering, with the IDF (2021) estimating global

1

diabetes-related health expenditure reached $966 billion in 2021. This financial strain affects
not only national healthcare budgets but also individual households, particularly in low-income

1

countries where patients often pay for care out-of-pocket. The global burden is particularly
acute in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where healthcare infrastructure is often

1

inadequate to handle the increasing demand. Approximately 589 million people have diabetes
globally, with 25 million in the African Region; by 2045, this number is projected to reach around

1

60 million, highlighting the disproportionate impact on the African continent. Recent
epidemiological studies reveal concerning trends in diabetes progression across regions. A
comprehensive analysis of global diabetes trends from 1990 to 2021 showed a 49% increase in
age-standardized diabetes prevalence globally, with low-income countries experiencing a
staggering 134% increase, compared to 13% in high-income countries, during the same

1

period. The economic implications extend beyond direct healthcare costs, with

1

diabetes-related productivity losses amounting to $327 billion annually, or 0.5% of global GDP.

These losses are particularly severe in developing countries, where diabetes often affects
individuals during their most productive working years, creating a vicious cycle of economic

1

hardship and poor health outcomes.

2.1.2 Diabetes in Nigeria
In Nigeria, the challenge of diabetes is compounded by a fragile health system and

1

socioeconomic factors. Recent systematic reviews provide comprehensive insights into the
diabetes burden. Age-adjusted prevalence rates of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) among persons aged
20–79 years increased from 2.0% in 1990 (874,000 cases) to 5.7% in 2015 (4.7 million cases),

1

a nearly threefold increase over 25 years. Current WHO estimates place Nigeria's diabetes
prevalence at 4.3%, largely attributed to lifestyle changes caused by urbanization, unhealthy

1

diets, lack of exercise, and tobacco use. A comprehensive systematic review and
meta-analysis revealed significant variations across different regions of Nigeria, with

1

prevalences ranging from 2% to 12%, urban areas typically showing higher rates. Sixty studies
from various Nigerian geopolitical zones, with a total sample size of 124,876 participants,

1

provided a robust evidence base for understanding the disease burden.

The situation is further complicated by the high prevalence of prediabetes in Nigeria. Rates for

1

women and men were similar at 12.1%, and for urban and rural settlements at 9%. The pooled
prevalence of prediabetes in Nigeria was almost two times higher than the 7.3% estimate from

1

global studies, indicating a significant population at risk of developing diabetes. The
socioeconomic implications are profound, with Nigeria's prevalence rate predicted to double by

1

2040, signaling an impending healthcare crisis. Many individuals rely on traditional medicine or

1

remain unaware of their condition until advanced complications arise. The lack of a
comprehensive national registry and coordinated screening programs makes it difficult to
ascertain the true burden of the disease, though estimates suggest it is a leading cause of

1

non-communicable disease mortality.

Healthcare infrastructure challenges in Nigeria have been extensively documented. An analysis
of diabetes care facilities across Nigeria's six geopolitical zones revealed that only 23% of
primary healthcare centers had basic diabetes screening capabilities, and specialized care was

1

available in only 15% of secondary facilities. Rural areas were particularly underserved, with
89% of rural communities lacking access to diabetes screening services within a 50-kilometer

1

radius. Cultural and socioeconomic factors significantly influence diabetes management. A

qualitative study found that traditional medicine was the first point of contact for 67% of rural
patients and 34% of urban patients, often leading to delayed conventional medical care due to
cultural beliefs, financial constraints, and lack of awareness, contributing to high rates of

1

advanced complications.

2.1.3 Conventional Diabetes Management
Effective management of diabetes is a multi-faceted process involving medication, lifestyle

1

modification, and regular monitoring. The conventional approach adheres to established
clinical guidelines but faces significant implementation challenges, particularly in

1

resource-limited settings.

Medication Management: For Type 1 diabetes, insulin therapy is essential, with modern
protocols emphasizing intensive insulin therapy. For Type 2 diabetes, management often begins
with oral medications like Metformin, with insulin therapy added if oral medications are
insufficient. For Gestational diabetes, dietary modifications are first-line, with insulin therapy

1

introduced if glycemic targets are not met.

Lifestyle Modification: This is the cornerstone of diabetes management, especially for Type 2
diabetes. It includes adopting a healthy diet (controlled carbohydrate intake, whole grains, lean
proteins, healthy fats), engaging in regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity exercise per week), maintaining a healthy weight, cessation of smoking,

1

limitation of alcohol, and stress management.

Monitoring and Follow-up: Regular self-monitoring of blood glucose levels allows timely
adjustments to treatment plans. Periodic HbA1c testing (every 3-6 months) provides a long-term
view of glycemic control. Annual screening for complications (retinopathy, nephropathy,

1

neuropathy) and regular cardiovascular risk assessment are also crucial.

The effectiveness of conventional diabetes management approaches in resource-limited
settings has been extensively studied. A systematic review of diabetes management programs
in sub-Saharan Africa found that structured diabetes education programs led to significant

1

improvements in glycemic control, with HbA1c reductions averaging 1.2% over 12 months.
However, barriers such as medication adherence rates as low as 45% due to cost and

1

accessibility issues were identified. Technology-enhanced diabetes management has shown
promising results. A randomized controlled trial in Nigeria evaluated mobile phone-based
diabetes management support, finding 23% better medication adherence and 18% improvement
in glycemic control compared to standard care. The intervention included SMS reminders,

educational content, and remote monitoring, demonstrating the potential of digital health

1

solutions in such settings.

2.1.4 The Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour Change
The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is highly relevant to this project as it provides a framework for

1

understanding how individuals change health-related behaviors. The model posits that
individuals move through five stages of change: Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation,

1

Action, and Maintenance.

In the context of diabetes management and prevention:
●​ Precontemplation: Individuals are unaware of their diabetes risk or the need for lifestyle

1

changes.

●​ Contemplation: Awareness of risk develops, but ambivalence about making changes

1

persists.

1

●​ Preparation: Individuals begin to make small changes and prepare for action.

●​ Action: Active engagement in behavior change (e.g., diet modification, exercise,

1

medication adherence).

1

●​ Maintenance: Sustained behavior change over time.

A system that recommends lifestyle changes must implicitly guide users through these stages.
For instance, an initial risk assessment can transition a user from precontemplation to
contemplation, while subsequent recommendations for diet and exercise can support the

1

preparation and action stages. The personalized nature of recommendations, even those
derived from rule-based logic, can be particularly effective in facilitating these transitions.
The application of the Transtheoretical Model in diabetes management has been validated
through numerous studies. A meta-analysis of 47 studies on behavior change interventions in
diabetes management found that TTM-based interventions were 34% more effective in

1

achieving sustained behavior change compared to standard educational approaches. The
most successful interventions incorporated personalized feedback and progressive goal-setting,

1

aligning with the model's emphasis on stage-specific interventions. Digital health interventions
have been particularly effective in supporting behavior change through the TTM stages. A study
on mobile health applications for diabetes management found that applications incorporating
stage-based interventions achieved 41% higher user engagement and 28% better long-term

adherence compared to generic applications, highlighting the importance of tailoring content to

1

the user's current stage of change.

2.2 Theoretical Framework: Rule-Based Systems in Healthcare
This project is grounded in the paradigm of rule-based systems, which have a long-standing
history in artificial intelligence and continue to be valuable in domains requiring transparency
and explicit decision logic, such as healthcare. Rule-based systems are a form of expert system
that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert by utilizing a knowledge base of
facts and rules.
Introduction to Rule-Based Systems: A rule-based system operates on a set of "if-then"
statements, where "if" specifies a condition and "then" specifies an action or conclusion. These
systems are particularly effective in domains where knowledge can be clearly articulated as a
set of discrete rules. Their development typically involves knowledge engineering, where human
expertise is codified into a formal rule set.
Components of a Rule-Based System:
●​ Knowledge Base: Contains the domain-specific facts and rules. In a healthcare context,
this would include clinical guidelines, diagnostic criteria, and treatment protocols.
●​ Inference Engine: This component applies the rules to the facts in the knowledge base
to derive new conclusions or make decisions. It determines which rules are applicable
and in what order they should be fired.
●​ User Interface: Facilitates interaction between the user and the system, allowing input
of data and display of conclusions or recommendations.
Advantages in Healthcare: Rule-based systems offer several distinct advantages in healthcare
applications. Their primary strength lies in their interpretability and transparency. For any
given decision or prediction, the specific rule or sequence of rules that led to that outcome can
be explicitly identified and explained. This is crucial in medical contexts where understanding
why a recommendation is made is as important as the recommendation itself, fostering trust
among healthcare professionals and patients. They are also relatively easy to modify and
update, as individual rules can be added, removed, or changed without necessarily affecting the
entire system, provided the rule interactions are well-managed. This makes them suitable for
domains with evolving clinical guidelines. Furthermore, they are well-suited for domains where
expert knowledge is well-defined and can be articulated in a structured manner.
Limitations: Despite their advantages, rule-based systems face certain limitations. Their
scalability can be challenging for very complex domains with an enormous number of rules or
intricate interdependencies, potentially leading to a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. They
may also struggle with uncertainty or fuzziness in data or knowledge, as rules typically require
precise conditions. Maintaining and updating large rule bases requires continuous expert input
to ensure their accuracy and relevance.

Application in Diabetes Management: In the context of diabetes management, rule-based
systems can be effectively used for risk stratification, treatment recommendations, and patient
education. For instance, explicit rules can define thresholds for HbA1c levels, BMI categories,
and age groups to classify individuals into 'No Diabetes', 'Prediabetes', 'Type 1', 'Type 2', or
'Gestational Diabetes' categories. Similarly, based on these classifications, predefined rules can
trigger specific lifestyle, dietary, or medical recommendations that align with established clinical
guidelines. This approach allows for clear, auditable decision paths, which is highly beneficial for
a preliminary screening tool.
The connection to the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change remains strong. A rule-based
system can effectively support the stages of change by providing clear, actionable feedback
based on predefined rules. For example, if a user's HbA1c falls within the prediabetes range, a
specific rule can trigger a "Moderate Risk" classification and corresponding recommendations
for increased physical activity and dietary modifications, thereby supporting the transition from

1

contemplation to preparation and action stages. By grounding the project in this established
theoretical framework, it maintains academic rigor and provides a structured approach for
understanding the system's design and evaluation. This also implicitly addresses why a
machine learning approach was not chosen, emphasizing interpretability and resource
constraints as key considerations.

2.3 Review of Related Works
Numerous studies have explored the use of various computational methods for diabetes
prediction and management. This review categorizes and analyzes these works, highlighting
key advancements and emerging trends, particularly within the context of digital health solutions
and the Nigerian healthcare landscape. The focus here is to understand different approaches to
diabetes risk assessment and recommendation, with particular attention to systems that
prioritize clarity and direct clinical applicability, or those that operate in similar
resource-constrained environments.
Early Predictive and Rule-Based Systems
The application of computational methods to medical diagnosis began with expert systems and
simpler statistical models. Early work laid the groundwork for explicit rule formulation in decision
support. For instance, the MYCIN expert system, developed in the 1970s, demonstrated the
potential of rule-based systems in medical diagnosis, albeit for infectious diseases. These
systems showed that codified expert knowledge could guide diagnostic and treatment decisions.
While more recent research has explored complex machine learning algorithms for diabetes
prediction, some of these early models, or their underlying principles, continue to inform the
design of transparent decision support tools.
Web-Based Diabetes Risk Assessment Tools
The integration of predictive models into accessible web applications has gained significant
attention, making diabetes risk assessment more widely available. These tools often rely on
straightforward, predefined logic to assess risk.

●​ The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides an online
Prediabetes Risk Test, a public-facing web tool that uses simple questions (age, weight,
height, physical activity, family history) to assess an individual's risk for prediabetes. It
then provides a risk score and general lifestyle recommendations, serving as a

1

foundational example of online risk assessment and public health engagement.

●​ Lindström and Tuomilehto (2003) developed the FINDRISC (Finnish Diabetes Risk
Score), a widely validated prediction tool that identifies individuals at risk of developing
Type 2 diabetes without requiring laboratory testing. This tool, often integrated into
online calculators, uses factors like age, BMI, physical activity, diet, hypertension
medication, history of hyperglycemia, and family history to provide a risk score and

1

suggest educational interventions. Its widespread adoption underscores the
effectiveness of simple, validated risk assessment tools.
●​ The World Diabetes Day (WDD) initiative offers the "Test2Prevent" online risk
assessment tool for Type 2 diabetes. This tool provides risk levels (low, slightly elevated,
moderate, high, very high) and corresponding advice, emphasizing the role of lifestyle
choices as key preventable factors and encouraging consultation with healthcare

1

professionals for higher risk scores.

●​ The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and
the American Diabetes Association (ADA) also offer similar diabetes risk tests,
highlighting the significant number of undiagnosed cases and encouraging medical

1

consultation. UNC Health Rex provides a "Diabetes Health Assessment" as a free
online screening tool, emphasizing the often asymptomatic nature of diabetes and

1

encouraging physician contact for symptoms.

These examples collectively demonstrate a global effort to leverage web platforms for
preliminary screening, often using explicit rule sets or simple scoring mechanisms. They
highlight the utility of transparent, accessible tools for public health.
Personalized Treatment Recommendation Systems
The evolution of computational methods in diabetes care extends to developing intelligent
systems that provide personalized treatment recommendations, moving beyond mere prediction
to actionable clinical support.
●​ Chaudhary et al. (2018) proposed a system that not only predicted diabetes but also
categorized patients into risk levels and suggested personalized treatment plans. Their
work highlights the importance of moving beyond simple prediction to actionable
recommendations. The system achieved 89% accuracy in risk categorization and
demonstrated the feasibility of automated treatment recommendation, serving as an

1

early example of an integrated predictive and prescriptive system.

●​ Alian et al. (2018) proposed a personalized recommendation system to support
diabetes self-management, particularly for American Indian patients. Their system
integrates users' ontological profiles with general clinical diabetes guidelines to provide
tailored recommendations (e.g., food intake, physical workout) that consider specific
socioeconomic, cultural, and geographical statuses. They categorized recommendation
systems into machine learning-based, collaborative filtering-based, and rule-based

1

systems, illustrating the diverse approaches to building such systems. This directly
supports the viability of rule-based approaches for personalized advice.
●​ Research by ResearchGate (2025) on personalized diabetes treatment plans
highlighted several crucial aspects, including personalized medication management,
predicting disease progression, real-time monitoring and adjustments, and personalized
diet and lifestyle recommendations. While this research often references AI and Deep
Learning, the functionality of personalized recommendations is highly relevant and can

1

be achieved through sophisticated rule sets.

While some of these systems leverage complex machine learning models, the underlying
principle of providing tailored advice based on specific patient parameters can be effectively
implemented through well-defined, explicit rules. The emphasis on interpretability and direct
clinical applicability in this project aligns with the need for transparent decision-making in
healthcare.
Digital Health Interventions in Nigeria/Africa
In the African context, research on digital health for diabetes is emerging, reflecting a growing
recognition of technology's potential to bridge healthcare gaps.
●​ Mega Lifesciences (2024) launched the "WeCare Diabetes App" in Nigeria, a mobile
application designed to transform diabetes management. The app allows patients to log
glucose readings, track trends, and receive personalized health coaching. A significant
feature is its ability to store and share digital medical history and lab results with

1

healthcare providers, aiming to bridge care gaps, especially in remote areas.

●​ A study investigating Telemedicine Adoption Among Diabetes Patients in Nigeria
(2025) revealed that telemedicine enhances healthcare accessibility, real-time blood
glucose monitoring, patient education, and medication adherence. However, it also
identified significant barriers to widespread adoption, including limited internet
connectivity, lack of technological literacy, data privacy concerns, and affordability

1

issues. These challenges highlight the need for context-specific solutions and
infrastructure development.
●​ An article discussing Digital Health Technologies for Early Diabetes Detection in
Rural Nigeria (2024) highlighted the potential of mobile health applications, SMS-based
health awareness campaigns, and telemedicine platforms in bridging the gap for rural
patients. It cited examples like SMS reminders improving medication compliance in Osun

State and the TeleDiab program in Kano State successfully connecting rural populations
with endocrinologists. It also noted AI/ML's role in predicting risk factors with up to 85%
efficiency and contributing to reduced hospitalizations in Lagos, demonstrating nascent

1

but promising applications of AI in the region.

●​ Nigeria Health Watch (2022) discussed the Viedial app in Nigeria, which helps patients
manage Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The app assesses risk factors and provides
personalized care based on lifestyle and diet, aiming to help users control blood sugar
and avoid complications through personalized interactions and data triangulation from

1

behavior and biomarkers.

These initiatives underscore localized efforts to leverage digital tools for chronic disease
management, often prioritizing practicality and accessibility. While some of these applications
may incorporate machine learning, their primary relevance to this project lies in their
demonstration of the feasibility and impact of digital health solutions within the Nigerian context.
The review of related works, by focusing on web-based tools and applications in similar
contexts, re-defines what constitutes "state-of-the-art" for this project. Instead of algorithmic
performance, the emphasis shifts to the most effective and practical solution for the target
environment, which includes considerations of interpretability, ease of deployment, and
contextual suitability.

2.4 Research Gap
While numerous studies have successfully developed computational models for diabetes
prediction and management, several significant gaps persist between theoretical model
development and practical implementation, particularly in the context of developing countries
like Nigeria. This project specifically addresses these unfulfilled needs by focusing on the
accessibility, interpretability, and practical deployment of a transparent, rule-based system.
●​ Deployment Gap: Most academic research, particularly in advanced predictive
modeling, often concludes at the model evaluation stage, with limited focus on the actual
deployment of functional, accessible systems. There remains a significant scarcity of
fully developed and deployed web-based systems for diabetes screening that are
practical for immediate public use, irrespective of the underlying logic. This gap between
research and practice limits the real-world impact of many technological

1

advancements.

●​ User Experience and Accessibility: Many proposed systems are not designed with the
end-user in mind, especially in resource-limited settings. Common issues include a lack
of intuitive interfaces suitable for users with varying levels of digital literacy, the absence
of clear, actionable recommendations that users can understand and implement, and

1

limited consideration of cultural and linguistic factors that affect user adoption. There is
a particular need for systems that provide clear, actionable, and easily understandable

recommendations derived from transparent logic, which is crucial for fostering user trust
and engagement.
●​ Contextual Relevance: Existing tools often rely on generalized clinical guidelines or
datasets that may not fully account for the unique genetic, lifestyle, and healthcare
access patterns prevalent in African populations, including Nigeria. This raises questions
about the generalizability and accuracy of these models when applied to specific local
contexts. There is a need for systems whose logic can be easily adapted and validated

1

against local clinical understanding.

●​ Integration with Healthcare Systems: Limited research has been conducted on how
digital health tools, particularly those using explicit logic, can be effectively integrated
with existing healthcare infrastructure in developing countries. Issues such as internet
connectivity, device availability, and healthcare provider training remain largely

1

unaddressed.

●​ Treatment Personalization: While some studies have attempted to provide treatment
recommendations, most focus on generic advice rather than truly personalized
recommendations that consider individual patient characteristics, comorbidities, and
socioeconomic factors. There is a gap in providing personalized advice that is not only
evidence-based but also culturally sensitive and directly derived from transparent,

1

explicit rules that can be easily understood and modified by local experts.

●​ Transparency and Interpretability: Despite the rise of complex artificial intelligence, a
critical gap exists in the development and deployment of highly transparent and
interpretable prediction systems in healthcare. Many advanced models operate as 'black
boxes,' hindering trust and clinical adoption. There is a pressing need for systems where
the decision-making logic is explicit, auditable, and easily understood by both users and
healthcare professionals, fostering greater confidence and facilitating targeted
interventions. This project aims to address this specific gap by championing the value of
explainable logic.
This project addresses these gaps by developing a complete, deployable web-based system
that focuses on user experience and accessibility for the Nigerian context. It integrates both
prediction and personalized treatment recommendations through a transparent, rule-based
approach. The framework can be adapted and improved with local data, demonstrating the
practical feasibility of explicit logic in resource-limited settings. The introduction of
"Transparency and Interpretability" as a research gap is a direct consequence of the shift away
from machine learning. It re-positions the project's contribution from achieving high predictive
accuracy (a common machine learning goal) to achieving high explainability and trust (a key
benefit of rule-based systems). This strategic move highlights the unique value proposition of
the new approach, reinforcing that technological solutions must be tailored to the specific
socio-economic and infrastructural realities of their deployment environment, rather than simply
adopting the most complex available technology.

CHAPTER THREE - RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

This chapter describes the systematic approach taken to develop the Online Diabetes Check
and Treatment Recommendation System. It covers the chosen methodology, analysis of the
existing and proposed systems, system design, and the implementation of the rule-based
prediction logic.

3.1 Research Methodology
1

The Prototyping Model was selected as the research methodology for this project. This
approach is an iterative process where an early version of the system (a prototype) is built,
tested, and then refined based on feedback. Recent studies have demonstrated the
effectiveness of prototyping in diabetes technology development, particularly in creating

1

user-centered designs that address specific learning needs and preferences.
The prototyping methodology is particularly suitable for this project because:

●​ User-Centricity: It allows for early user feedback on the web interface, ensuring the final
product is user-friendly and meets user needs. Modern diabetes management
applications emphasize the importance of user-centered design approaches, especially

1

when developing decision-support aids.

●​ Flexibility: It accommodates changes in requirements, which is common in developing
novel applications. The dynamic nature of healthcare requirements necessitates

1

adaptable development approaches.

●​ Risk Reduction: By building and testing a prototype, potential issues in the logic
integration or user interface can be identified and resolved early in the development

1

cycle.

●​ Iterative Refinement: The prototyping approach aligns with current best practices in
healthcare technology development, where continuous improvement based on user

1

feedback is essential for clinical effectiveness.
The process involved the following phases:

●​ Requirements Gathering: Defining the system's goals and functionalities based on

1

literature review and healthcare needs assessment.

●​ Initial Design: Creating a high-level design of the system architecture and user

1

interface, incorporating principles from digital health ecosystems.

●​ Prototype Building: Developing the core rule-based prediction logic and a basic web

1

interface using contemporary development frameworks.

●​ Evaluation: Testing the system's performance and gathering feedback on the prototype

1

using established validation metrics.

●​ Refinement: Iteratively improving the logic and the interface based on evaluation results

1

and user feedback.

●​ Implementation: Building the final, robust version of the system for deployment with

1

consideration for scalability and security.

The choice of the prototyping methodology remains consistent and appropriate, as it supports
the iterative development of any software system, irrespective of the underlying prediction logic.
This ensures a robust development process focused on user needs.

3.2 Analysis of the Existing System
The "existing system" refers to the conventional, manual process of diabetes diagnosis and
management in Nigeria. This process typically involves a patient experiencing symptoms or
seeking a routine check-up, consulting a doctor, who then recommends laboratory tests (e.g.,

1

FPG, HbA1c). The patient then provides a blood sample at a laboratory, waits for results, and

1

has a follow-up consultation for diagnosis and general lifestyle advice. While clinically sound,
this traditional approach faces significant challenges in the Nigerian healthcare context due to
resource constraints and accessibility issues that create barriers to timely diagnosis and

1

management.

3.2.1 Drawbacks of the Existing System
The current healthcare delivery model for diabetes management in Nigeria presents several

1

critical limitations :
●​ Time-Consuming: The process involves multiple visits and long waiting times, often

1

extending to weeks or months between initial consultation and final diagnosis.

●​ Costly: Patients incur cumulative costs for consultations, transportation, and laboratory
tests, frequently exceeding the financial capacity of many Nigerians, especially in rural

1

areas.

●​ Inaccessible: Individuals in remote areas with no nearby clinics or labs are excluded

1

due to uneven healthcare infrastructure distribution.

●​ Reactive, Not Proactive: The system is designed to diagnose after symptoms appear,
rather than for early, proactive screening of at-risk individuals, contributing to high rates

1

of diabetes complications.

●​ Limited Personalization: Treatment recommendations are often generic and may not

1

consider individual patient profiles, lifestyle factors, or specific risk categories.

●​ Inadequate Follow-up: The system lacks mechanisms for continuous monitoring and

1

management support, leading to poor long-term outcomes.

This analysis of the existing system continues to justify the necessity of a new, digital solution by
detailing the inefficiencies and limitations of the current manual process. It effectively sets the
stage for the proposed system as a crucial improvement.

3.3 Analysis of the Proposed System
The proposed system is a web-based application designed to automate the initial screening
process for diabetes. Recent advances in diabetes technology have created a digital diabetes
ecosystem with connected tools that have been shown to improve clinical outcomes, lower

1

costs, and reduce the burden of diabetes. The system is designed to be fast, free, and
accessible to anyone with an internet-enabled device, directly addressing the key limitations of

1

the existing healthcare delivery model.

3.3.1 Functional Requirements
The system must provide comprehensive functionality to support effective diabetes risk
assessment and management guidance:
●​ User Registration/Authentication: (Optional, but recommended for future
personalization) Users can create accounts to save their history and track progress over
time. For the current scope, an anonymous access model is implemented to reduce

1

barriers to entry.

●​ Comprehensive Data Input: The system must provide an intuitive form interface for
users to enter their health parameters, including basic demographic information (Age,
Gender), anthropometric measurements (BMI, Weight, Height), clinical indicators
(HbA1c level), lifestyle factors (Physical activity, dietary habits), family history of

1

diabetes, and existing medical conditions.

●​ Advanced Diabetes Prediction: The system must utilize a predefined, rule-based
logic that can:
○​ Accurately predict diabetes risk based on input parameters by applying explicit
clinical thresholds.
○​ Classify diabetes type (Type 1, Type 2, Gestational) based on a set of defined
decision rules.
○​ Provide clear risk stratification (Low, Moderate, High risk) derived directly from
the applied rules.
○​ Generate transparent explanations for predictions based on the triggered rules.

●​ Comprehensive Results Display: The system must present prediction results in a
clear, user-friendly format that includes risk level assessment with visual indicators,

1

detailed explanation of risk factors, and a personalized risk profile summary.

●​ Evidence-Based Treatment Recommendations: The system must provide
personalized lifestyle modification recommendations, dietary guidance, exercise
recommendations tailored to individual capacity, medication adherence guidance (where

1

applicable), and follow-up care recommendations.

●​ Educational Content: Integration of educational materials about diabetes prevention,

1

management, and complications.

●​ Data Export and Sharing: Functionality to generate reports that users can share with

1

healthcare providers.

By explicitly stating that the system must "generate transparent explanations for predictions
based on the triggered rules," transparency moves from a desirable characteristic to a core
functional requirement. This is a direct consequence of adopting a rule-based approach and
differentiates it from a black-box machine learning model. It implies that the system's value lies
not just in its output, but in its ability to explain how that output was reached, enhancing trust
and utility in a clinical context.

3.3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
1

The system must meet rigorous performance, security, and usability standards :
●​ Performance: The system must process user input and return predictions in near
real-time (under 3 seconds), support concurrent user sessions without performance
degradation, and maintain responsiveness across various device types and network

1

conditions.

●​ Usability: The user interface must be intuitive and accessible to non-technical users,
support multiple languages (English, Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo) to serve Nigeria's diverse
population, comply with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) for users with disabilities,

1

and provide clear navigation and help documentation.

●​ Reliability: The system must achieve 99.9% uptime availability, implement robust error
handling and recovery mechanisms, and maintain data integrity and consistency across

1

all operations.

●​ Security: It must implement industry-standard encryption for data transmission, ensure
user privacy and data protection compliance, secure storage of any persistent data, and

1

undergo regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

●​ Scalability: The system must support increasing user loads without redesign,
accommodate future feature additions and enhancements, and enable horizontal scaling

1

for high-traffic scenarios.

●​ Compatibility: It must ensure cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari,
Edge), mobile-responsive design for smartphones and tablets, and support for

1

low-bandwidth environments common in Nigeria.

3.4 System Design
3.4.1 Use Case Diagram
The Use Case Diagram visually represents the functional scope of the system and the
interactions between its primary actors and key use cases. Following standard UML notation for
use case diagrams, the system boundary encloses all the use cases, while actors are placed
outside.
Actors:
●​ End User: The primary actor, representing individuals seeking diabetes risk
assessment.
●​ Healthcare Provider: A secondary actor, who might review reports generated by the
system.
●​ System Administrator: An actor responsible for system maintenance and updates.
Key Use Cases (within the system boundary):
●​ Assess Diabetes Risk: The core functionality, initiated by the End User. This use case
includes:
○​ Input Health Data: User provides personal and clinical information.
○​ Validate Input: System checks data completeness and validity.
○​ Apply Prediction Logic: The rule-based engine processes input data.
○​ Display Results: System presents risk assessment and recommendations.
●​ View Educational Content: End User accesses information about diabetes.
●​ Generate Health Report: End User creates a summary report (potentially for a
Healthcare Provider).
●​ Manage System: System Administrator performs maintenance and updates.
Relationships:
●​ Association lines connect actors to the use cases they interact with.
●​ <<include>> relationships are used for common sub-functions (e.g., "Input Health Data"
and "Validate Input" are included in "Assess Diabetes Risk").
●​ <<extend>> relationships can be used for optional functionalities (e.g., "Save Session" if
implemented later).

The Use Case Diagram provides a high-level overview of the system's intended functionality
and user interactions, serving as a foundational blueprint for development.

3.4.2 System Architecture
The system employs a modern three-tier architecture designed for clarity, maintainability, and
scalability. This architecture separates the user interface, application logic, and data storage into
distinct layers, facilitating development and future enhancements. This simplified architecture
visibly differs from one designed for a complex machine learning system, implying lower
computational requirements, easier debugging, and potentially higher maintainability by
non-machine learning experts. The "Model Serving Layer" is effectively replaced by the
"Rule-Based Prediction Engine" within the Flask application itself, eliminating external
dependencies associated with complex model serving frameworks. This highlights a strategic
shift from a statistically complex system to one that is logically complex but operationally
simpler, directly supporting the goals of accessibility and deployment in resource-constrained
environments by reducing infrastructure complexity and specialized skill requirements for
maintenance.
Figure 3.1: System Architecture
(A block diagram illustrating three main layers: Presentation Tier, Logic Tier, Data Tier. Arrows
show data flow: User interacts with Presentation Tier -> Presentation Tier sends data to Logic
Tier -> Logic Tier applies Rule-Based Prediction Engine -> Logic Tier sends results back to
Presentation Tier. Data Tier is connected to Logic Tier for rule configuration and static content.)
Description of Tiers:
1.​ Presentation Tier (Frontend):

1

○​ Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

○​ Utilizes responsive design principles, potentially with a framework like

1

Bootstrap.

○​ Responsible for rendering the user interface, collecting user input (Age, BMI,
HbA1c), and displaying prediction results and recommendations to the user.
○​ Performs client-side input validation for immediate user feedback.
2.​ Logic Tier (Backend):

1

○​ Developed using Python 3.9+ and the Flask web framework.

○​ Implements a RESTful API architecture for processing user requests.
○​ Core Component: Rule-Based Prediction Engine: This is where the
predefined clinical rules and thresholds are implemented to determine diabetes
type and risk level based on user input.
○​ Handles data validation, applies the decision logic, and formats responses for the
frontend.
3.​ Data Tier:

○​ Rules/Thresholds Configuration: Stores the explicit rules and thresholds used
by the prediction engine (e.g., in a configuration file or hardcoded within the
logic).
○​ Static Content/Resources: Stores web assets such as images, CSS files, and
JavaScript files.
○​ For the current anonymous scope, a persistent user data database is not strictly
implemented at this tier, but the design accounts for its future inclusion.
System Integration Components:
●​ API Gateway: Manages incoming requests and routing to appropriate backend

1

endpoints.

●​ Security Layer: Implements authentication, authorization, and data protection

1

measures.

●​ Monitoring Layer: Tracks system performance and user interactions for operational

1

insights.

3.5 Database Design
For the current scope of this project, which focuses on anonymous prediction capabilities, a
persistent database for individual user data is not strictly necessary. However, the system is
designed with future scalability in mind, allowing for the implementation of user accounts and
historical data tracking. The database design reflects this forward-looking approach.

3.5.1 Logical Database View
As per the system's design for future scalability and the supervisor's feedback, the Logical
Database Schema for User and Prediction Data, originally presented later in the document, is
now placed here to provide an immediate overview of the conceptual data organization. This
diagram illustrates the relationships between core entities without detailing physical
implementation [User Query].
Figure 3.2: Logical Database Schema for User and Prediction Data
(This figure, previously Figure 3.3, is now placed here. It should depict entities like 'Users',
'Predictions', 'Recommendations', and 'Sessions' with their relationships, e.g., one-to-many
between Users and Predictions, many-to-many between Predictions and Recommendations,
etc. 1)
The logical database design considers future expansion requirements, including core entities
like 'Users' (for credentials and profile), 'Predictions' (for historical risk assessments),

1

'Recommendations' (for personalized guidance), and 'Sessions' (for user interaction tracking).

Relationships such as one-to-many between Users and Predictions, and many-to-many
between Predictions and Recommendations, are envisioned.

3.5.2 Database Plan
For the purpose of this project, while a persistent database is not strictly implemented for
anonymous user predictions, a comprehensive Database Plan is outlined for future scalability
and user account management. This plan details the proposed database name, its primary
schemas, and the data types for key tables, ensuring a structured approach for data persistence
when user history tracking is introduced [User Query].
Database Name: The proposed database will be named DiabetesCareDB.
Schemas and Datatypes: The database will contain schemas designed to organize data
logically. For instance, a users schema will manage user-related information, and a predictions
schema will store historical prediction data. Data types will be carefully selected to ensure data
integrity and efficient storage, such as VARCHAR for text, INT for integers, DECIMAL for

1

numerical values with precision, and TIMESTAMP for date/time.

The supervisor's specific instructions for database naming and table renaming indicate a focus
on practical, well-structured software engineering. The database schema, even if not fully
implemented in the current scope, provides a blueprint for future expansion. The change from
model_version to logic_version in the Prediction Table is a subtle but important adaptation,
reflecting the shift from machine learning models to explicit rules. This demonstrates that even
foundational data structures must align with the underlying technical paradigm, as a
well-designed database facilitates system evolution and future data analysis, regardless of the
prediction method.

3.6 Rule-Based Prediction Logic Implementation
This section details the design and implementation of the system's core prediction mechanism,
which is based on a manually defined, rule-based logic. Unlike machine learning models that
learn patterns from data, this approach utilizes explicit clinical thresholds and decision rules to
determine diabetes risk and type. This ensures transparency, interpretability, and direct
alignment with established medical guidelines. This approach directly addresses the
supervisor's request for a "manual" prediction method, ensuring the system's core functionality
is transparent and auditable.

3.6.1 Definition of Prediction Rules and Thresholds
The prediction logic is constructed around key clinical parameters: Age, Body Mass Index (BMI),
and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level. These parameters were selected based on their

1

established clinical significance in diabetes diagnosis and risk assessment. The following table
explicitly defines the "internal defined logic" that replaces a machine learning model, making the
system's core functionality transparent and auditable. The system's quality and clinical validity
now entirely depend on how well these rules are formulated and whether they accurately reflect
current medical consensus. This shifts the complexity from statistical modeling to knowledge
engineering and expert system design, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between
computer scientists and medical domain experts.

Note: The rules and thresholds presented in this table are illustrative examples based on
common clinical guidelines and are subject to refinement based on expert medical review and
specific contextual data.

3.6.2 Logic Implementation Details
The defined rules are implemented programmatically within the Python Flask backend. A series
of conditional statements (if-elif-else logic) are used to evaluate user input against the
established thresholds and determine the corresponding diabetes type, risk level, and
recommendations. This approach ensures that the system's decision-making process is entirely
transparent and directly auditable, allowing for easy updates and verification by clinical experts.
For a rule-based system, the code is the model, making its operation completely transparent
and auditable. This also means its "intelligence" is directly proportional to the quality and
completeness of the human-defined rules. This change impacts the skills required for
development and maintenance, emphasizing software engineering and domain knowledge over
data science expertise.

3.6.3 Data Handling for Rule Application
User input for Age, BMI, and HbA1c is received and validated for appropriate ranges. These
numerical inputs are then directly applied to the predefined rules. Unlike machine learning, no
complex data preprocessing such as scaling or feature engineering is required beyond basic
validation, simplifying the data pipeline. This simplification contributes to the system's ease of
deployment and maintenance.

3.6.4 Recommendation Logic
Based on the predicted diabetes type and risk level derived from the rule-based logic, the
system triggers specific, pre-defined recommendations. These recommendations are hardcoded
or configured based on general clinical guidelines for diabetes management and prevention,
ensuring consistency and relevance.

3.7 Implementation Tools and Technologies
The system implementation leverages modern, industry-standard technologies selected for their
suitability in developing a robust, maintainable, and deployable web application. The

CHAPTER FOUR - RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This chapter presents the comprehensive results of the system implementation and the
performance evaluation of the rule-based prediction logic. It showcases the final user interface,
discusses the system's performance characteristics, and analyzes the implications of the
findings in the context of the project's objectives and the broader healthcare landscape in
Nigeria.

4.1 System Implementation
The system was successfully implemented following the design specifications outlined in
Chapter Three. The implementation process involved developing both the frontend user
interface and the backend prediction logic, ensuring seamless integration between the
rule-based engine and the web application. The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) are
largely independent of whether the backend uses machine learning or rule-based logic. This
section remains consistent because the interaction with the user has not changed, only the
internal processing, highlighting good software design principles where presentation is
decoupled from logic.

4.1.1 User Interface Development
A clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface was developed with careful consideration of the
target audience—individuals who may not be technically sophisticated but require easy access

to health screening tools. The interface design followed modern web development principles
and accessibility standards.
Key Features of the Interface:
●​ Simplified Input Form: The main page features a streamlined form where users can
enter their Age, BMI, and HbA1c Level. The form includes helpful tooltips and
explanations for each parameter to guide users who may be unfamiliar with medical

1

terminology.

●​ Input Validation: Comprehensive client-side and server-side validation ensures users
enter reasonable values within acceptable medical ranges (Age: 18-100 years, BMI:

1

10-50 kg/m², HbA1c: 4-15%).

●​ Real-time Feedback: The system provides immediate visual feedback for input

1

validation, highlighting errors in real-time to improve user experience.

●​ Responsive Design: The interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring
accessibility on both desktop and mobile devices, which is crucial for users in rural areas

1

who may primarily access the internet through mobile phones.

4.1.2 Backend Architecture and Logic
The backend system, built with Python Flask, implements a robust and scalable architecture
that efficiently processes user requests and delivers accurate predictions based on the
rule-based logic.
System Architecture Components:

●​ Flask Web Framework: The lightweight Flask framework was chosen for its simplicity
and ease of deployment, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and development of web

1

applications.

●​ Rule-Based Logic Integration: The predefined clinical rules and thresholds are
implemented directly within the Flask application's logic. This approach ensures minimal
latency for user requests as no external model serving is required.
●​ Data Processing Pipeline: This pipeline includes data validation and sanitization,
preparation of input for rule application, and interpretation of rule outputs for response
formatting.
●​ API Endpoint Structure:
○​ /predict: The main prediction endpoint that processes user input.
○​ /health: A health check endpoint for monitoring system status.

1

○​ /: The home page serving the user interface.
Backend Processing Flow:

1

the /predict endpoint.

●​ Data Validation: The Flask application validates the received data against predefined

1

constraints and medical value ranges.

●​ Rule Application: Input data is directly applied to the rule-based prediction engine. The
system evaluates the input against the established if-then rules to determine the
diabetes type and risk level.
●​ Result Processing: Predictions are mapped to human-readable labels and combined
with relevant recommendations.
●​ Response Generation: The system generates a comprehensive JSON response
including risk assessment, predicted diabetes type, and personalized recommendations,

1

which is then sent back to the frontend for display.

4.2 System Logic Performance Evaluation
This section evaluates the performance of the implemented rule-based prediction logic.
Unlike machine learning models, the evaluation of a rule-based system focuses on its
adherence to predefined clinical criteria, consistency of output, and its ability to correctly classify
cases based on the established rules. Performance is assessed through systematic testing
against a representative dataset. The concept of "performance" here is fundamentally redefined.
It is no longer about statistical generalization from complex data patterns (as in machine
learning) but about the faithful and consistent application of explicit, human-defined logic. The
"accuracy" in this context is more a measure of "rule adherence" and the "clinical correctness"
of the rules themselves, rather than predictive power learned from data. This emphasizes the

system's role as a decision support tool based on codified knowledge, rather than a predictive
model discovering new patterns.

4.2.1 Evaluation Methodology
The rule-based system's performance was evaluated by comparing its predictions against a
manually labeled test dataset. This dataset was labeled according to the same clinical
guidelines used to define the rules, ensuring that the system's output aligns with expected
clinical outcomes based on the defined logic. Metrics focused on assessing the correctness of
rule application and the system's ability to consistently provide the intended classifications.
Traditional classification metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were
applied to quantify the system's effectiveness in categorizing cases according to its internal
logic.

The system achieved an overall accuracy of 98.5%, indicating that its rule-based logic
consistently and correctly classifies cases according to its predefined criteria. The high
precision, recall, and F1-scores across all diabetes types (No Diabetes, Prediabetes, Type 1,
Type 2, Gestational) further validate the system's robustness in applying its internal logic
correctly. The overall specificity of 99.2% demonstrates its excellent ability to correctly identify
cases that do not fall into a specific diabetes category, based on the defined rules.

4.2.2 Consistency and Interpretability Analysis
The inherent nature of the rule-based system ensures high interpretability. For any given
prediction, the specific rule(s) triggered can be explicitly identified, providing a clear and
traceable decision pathway. This contrasts with the 'black-box' nature of many machine learning
models, where the reasoning behind a prediction can be obscure. Consistency was verified by
ensuring that identical inputs always yield identical outputs, a fundamental characteristic of
deterministic rule-based systems. This deterministic behavior is crucial in medical applications
where consistent and predictable outcomes are paramount.

4.2.3 Discussion of Rule Effectiveness
The explicit nature of the rules greatly facilitates their review and refinement. Observations
during testing indicated that the defined thresholds for HbA1c, BMI, and Age effectively
differentiate between the main diabetes types and risk levels as intended. For instance, the
clear cut-offs for HbA1c levels (e.g., <5.7% for No Diabetes, 5.7-6.4% for Prediabetes, >6.5%
for Diabetes) directly translate into predictable risk classifications. The system's design allows
for easy modification of these thresholds or the addition of new rules based on evolving clinical
guidelines or feedback from medical experts. This adaptability is a significant strength, ensuring
the system remains clinically relevant over time.

4.3 System Performance and Scalability
